#+TITLE: Additive sound synthesis


* Context

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis][Additive synthesis]] allows sound creation through the addition of
(potentially many) sine waves.  While there are [[http://www.sonicspot.com/guide/synthesistypes.html][other forms of synthesis]]
, additive is amongst the most expressive but also the most challenging
ones because of the model's complexity.


* Task

The student should understand the available models (e.g. [harmonykit])
and UI for sound synthesis and improve the state of the art in
either/both of them.

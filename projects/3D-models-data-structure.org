#+TITLE: 3D models realistic movements



* Context

In order to implement state of the art [paper] realistic motion
planning, one must be able to efficiently handle a very large number
($\approx 10^5$) of 3D primitives (i.e. triangles) and perform queries
on them. A current implementation is available, but cannot become the
reference standard software because it relies on non-free software
for some 3D operations [octree].

* Task

The student should understand the available algorithm (used in [video]) and :
- provide insights on how to enhance it
- implement the needed data-structures in an efficient way.

* Implementation notes

The preferred technologies for implementation are in increasing order of specificity :
- C++
- NT² https://github.com/MetaScale/nt2

Furthermore, the documentation and code samples from http://www.geometrictools.com should be reviewed
thoroughly [distance].

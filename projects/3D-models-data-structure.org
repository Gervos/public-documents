#+TITLE: 3D models realistic movements



* Context

In order to implement state of the art [paper] realistic motion
planning, one must be able to efficiently handle a very large number
($\approx 10^5$) of 3D primitives (i.e. triangles) and perform queries
on them.

* Task

The student should understand the available algorithm and :
- provide insights on how to enhance it
- implement the needed data-structures to enable an efficient implementation.

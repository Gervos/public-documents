#+TITLE: Synthetic Data Set for distributed photovoltaic forecasting

* Context
Current research is ongoing to improve photo-voltaic energy production
forecasting though collaborative distributed algorithms that model
clouds movements. Real atmospheric measurements are available to assess
the performance of the algorithm. However, synthetic data sets would be
useful to make controlled experiments and study when the algorithm if most/least effective.
